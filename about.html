				<h2>Me and Camera</h2>
				<p>I have been interested in photography since early childhood. My father has been working for a Media company for already 20 years now, whereas my mother is a famous designer. I was always part of their jobs and was studying and participating in their projects. Also, I was going to the school of photography and step by step getting more into this field. After gaining some experience, I have decided to take my relationship with the camera to the next level and work on my own style. This website is a representation of that.</p>
